# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to add a skill. This repo is a shared, public collection of agent skills for Unity workflows, and new contributions are welcome.

## Before you start

This is a **public** repository built on the open [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) standard. Anything you contribute ships publicly, so a skill must not reference anything internal: no internal services, internal URLs, credentials, or confidential workflows. If a skill only makes sense inside Unity's network, it doesn't belong here.

## Skill structure

Each skill is a folder under `skills/`, with a `SKILL.md` at its root:

```
skills/
  your-skill/
    SKILL.md
```

`SKILL.md` starts with YAML frontmatter, then the instructions the agent follows. The `unity-cli` skill is a good template to copy:

```yaml
---
name: your-skill
description: Use when … (one or two sentences on exactly when an agent should reach for this skill).
allowed-tools:
  - Bash
---
```

- `name`: matches the folder name, in kebab-case.
- `description`: this is the trigger the agent matches against to decide whether to run the skill, so make it specific about when the skill applies. "Use when …" is a good, clear shape and a fine default, but it's not required — what matters is that the description reads as a precise trigger. If your description is already tuned against real usage, keep it; don't rewrite it just to match a template.
- `allowed-tools`: optional. List the tools the skill needs, or leave it out if there's no restriction.

A README, CHANGELOG, and reference `.md` files alongside `SKILL.md` are all fine; the installer pulls the whole folder. Keep `SKILL.md` focused on instructions and move long reference material into separate files it links to.

Submit skills as plain folders committed to the repo. Don't check in a zipped `.skill` archive. Agents read `SKILL.md` directly, which is what the skills.sh tooling and review expect. You're welcome to package a `.skill` for distribution elsewhere.

## Versioning

There's no per-skill release mechanism. Versioning is just the repo's git history and PRs. A `CHANGELOG.md` inside your skill folder is welcome as documentation, but nothing automated reads it.

## Submitting

1. Add your skill folder under `skills/`.
2. Test it with realistic prompts in your own agent first.
3. Open a PR. One skill per PR keeps reviews easy and is a fine default, but it's not a hard rule — batching related skills into a single PR, or splitting a large contribution across a few PRs, is equally welcome. Do whatever's easiest to review; if you group several skills together, just say so in the PR description.
4. A maintainer reviews and merges.
